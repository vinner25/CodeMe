#Binary Tree
A Binary Tree is a Tree in which each Node can have maximum of two child nodes. 

Eg:   
 >                5 
>           3  8   13  2

#Binary Search Tree
A Binary search tree is a binary tree in which the left most nodes <= root node < right most nodes.
Eg:
>               12 
>           3  8   13 
>          1 2    15     

#Complete Binary Tree
A Complete Binary Tree is a binary tree where node is filled or if not filled than filled from left side.
Eg:
>               12 
>           3  8   13

#Full Binary Tree
A Full Binary Tree is a binary tree where each node has either two children or no children.
Eg:
>               12 
>           3  8  

#Perfect Binary Tree
A Perfect Binary Tree is a binary tree which is both complete and full.
Eg:
>                  12 
>               8       13 
>             19 21   15  47
